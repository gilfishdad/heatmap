The error message "ValueError: Matplotlib pane does not support objects of type 'Matplotlib'" indicates that you are trying to use a Matplotlib object in a context where it is not supported. This error can occur when you try to use a Matplotlib object as a widget in a GUI application, such as PyQt or Tkinter.

To fix this error, you will need to convert the Matplotlib object to a widget that is compatible with the GUI framework you are using. One way to do this is to use the matplotlib.widgets.Widget class, which allows you to create a widget that displays a Matplotlib figure.

Here is an example of how you can use the Widget class to create a widget that displays a Matplotlib figure:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.widgets import Widget

# Create a figure and add a plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3])

# Create a widget that displays the figure
widget = Widget(fig)

# Add the widget to a GUI application
# For example, in PyQt:
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow

app = QApplication([])
window = QMainWindow()
window.setCentralWidget(widget)
window.show()
app.exec_()

Alternatively, you can use the matplotlib.backends.backend_qt.QtFigureCanvas class to create a widget that displays a Matplotlib figure. This class is specifically designed for use with PyQt, and it provides a more seamless integration with the GUI framework.

from matplotlib.backends.backend_qt import QtFigureCanvas

# Create a figure and add a plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3])

# Create a widget that displays the figure
canvas = QtFigureCanvas(fig)

# Add the widget to a GUI application
# For example, in PyQt:
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow

app = QApplication([])
window = QMainWindow()
window.setCentralWidget(canvas)
window.show()
app.exec_()

By using the Widget class or the QtFigureCanvas class, you can create a widget that displays a Matplotlib figure and integrate it seamlessly with your GUI application.
